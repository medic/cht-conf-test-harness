# Test Harness for CHT Configuration

## Usage

View the documentation on [CHT Docs](http://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/cht-conf-test-harness/).

### Compatibility

The cht-conf-test-harness is targeted at specific versions of the CHT Core Framework. This allows you to run your tests and validate your config against a specific version of the CHT before deploying it to a live environment.

The following table shows the compatibility between the test harness and the CHT Core Framework (including the `coreVersion` values you can use in your harness configuration):

| cht-conf-test-harness | CHT Core Framework | Supported `coreVersion` values                |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 2.x                   | 3.9.x+             | `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`, `3.13`, `3.14` |
| 3.x                   | 4.0.x-4.5.x        | `4.0`                                         |
| 4.x                   | 4.6.x+             | `4.6`                                         |
