If your subclassed however you cannot return a new instance of the parent class as it will not be the right sub class. `declare` provides a way around this by setting the `_static` property on each isntance of the class.\n     *\n     * Lets add a reproduce method `Mammal`\n     *\n     * ```\n     * reproduce : function(options){\n     *     return new this._static(options);\n     * }\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Now in each subclass you can call reproduce and get the proper type.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * var myDog = new Dog();\n     * var myDogsChild = myDog.reproduce();\n     *\n     * myDogsChild instanceof Dog; //true\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ###Using the `as`\n     *\n     * `declare` also provides an `as` method which allows you to add your class to an object or if your using node.js you can pass in `module` and the class will be exported as the module.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * var animals = {};\n     *\n     * Mammal.as(animals, \"Dog\");\n     * Wolf.as(animals, \"Wolf\");\n     * Dog.as(animals, \"Dog\");\n     * Breed.as(animals, \"Breed\");\n     *\n     * var myDog = new animals.Dog();\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Or in node\n     *\n     * ```\n     * Mammal.as(exports, \"Dog\");\n     * Wolf.as(exports, \"Wolf\");\n     * Dog.as(exports, \"Dog\");\n     * Breed.as(exports, \"Breed\");\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * To export a class as the `module` in node\n     *\n     * ```\n     * Mammal.as(module);\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     */\n    function createDeclared() {\n        var arraySlice = Array.prototype.slice, classCounter = 0, Base, forceNew = new Function();\n\n        var SUPER_REGEXP = /(super)/g;\n\n        function argsToArray(args, slice) {\n            slice = slice || 0;\n            return arraySlice.call(args, slice);\n        }\n\n        function isArray(obj) {\n            return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj) === \"[object Array]\";\n        }\n\n        function isObject(obj) {\n            var undef;\n            return obj !== null && obj !== undef && typeof obj === \"object\";\n        }\n\n        function isHash(obj) {\n            var ret = isObject(obj);\n            return ret && obj.constructor === Object;\n        }\n\n        var isArguments = function _isArguments(object) {\n            return Object.prototype.toString.call(object) === '[object Arguments]';\n        };\n\n        if (!isArguments(arguments)) {\n            isArguments = function _isArguments(obj) {\n                return !!(obj && obj.hasOwnProperty(\"callee\"));\n            };\n        }\n\n        function indexOf(arr, item) {\n            if (arr && arr.length) {\n                for (var i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; i++) {\n                    if (arr[i] === item) {\n                        return i;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            return -1;\n        }\n\n        function merge(target, source, exclude) {\n            var name, s;\n            for (name in source) {\n                if (source.hasOwnProperty(name) && indexOf(exclude, name) === -1) {\n                    s = source[name];\n                    if (!(name in target) || (target[name] !== s)) {\n                        target[name] = s;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            return target;\n        }\n\n        function callSuper(args, a) {\n            var meta = this.__meta,\n                supers = meta.supers,\n                l = supers.length, superMeta = meta.superMeta, pos = superMeta.pos;\n            if (l > pos) {\n                args = !args ?

@header\n     * [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/doug-martin/extender.png)](http://travis-ci.org/doug-martin/extender)\n     * # Extender\n     *\n     * `extender` is a library that helps in making chainable APIs, by creating a function that accepts different values and returns an object decorated with functions based on the type.\n     *\n     * ## Why Is Extender Different?\n     *\n     * Extender is different than normal chaining because is does more than return `this`. It decorates your values in a type safe manner.\n     *\n     * For example if you return an array from a string based method then the returned value will be decorated with array methods and not the string methods. This allow you as the developer to focus on your API and not worrying about how to properly build and connect your API.\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Installation\n     *\n     * ```\n     * npm install extender\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Or [download the source](https://raw.github.com/doug-martin/extender/master/extender.js) ([minified](https://raw.github.com/doug-martin/extender/master/extender-min.js))\n     *\n     * **Note** `extender` depends on [`declare.js`](http://doug-martin.github.com/declare.js/).\n     *\n     * ### Requirejs\n     *\n     * To use with requirejs place the `extend` source in the root scripts directory\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     *\n     * define([\"extender\"], function(extender){\n     * });\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * ## Usage\n     *\n     * **`extender.define(tester, decorations)`**\n     *\n     * To create your own extender call the `extender.define` function.\n     *\n     * This function accepts an optional tester which is used to determine a value should be decorated with the specified `decorations`\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * function isString(obj) {\n     *     return !isUndefinedOrNull(obj) && (typeof obj === \"string\" || obj instanceof String);\n     * }\n     *\n     *\n     * var myExtender = extender.define(isString, {\n     *\t\tmultiply: function (str, times) {\n     *\t\t\tvar ret = str;\n     *\t\t\tfor (var i = 1; i < times; i++) {\n     *\t\t\t\tret += str;\n     *\t\t\t}\n     *\t\t\treturn ret;\n     *\t\t},\n     *\t\ttoArray: function (str, delim) {\n     *\t\t\tdelim = delim || \"\";\n     *\t\t\treturn str.split(delim);\n     *\t\t}\n     *\t});\n     *\n     * myExtender(\"hello\").multiply(2).value(); //hellohello\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * If you do not specify a tester function and just pass in an object of `functions` then all values passed in will be decorated with methods.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     *\n     * function isUndefined(obj) {\n     *     var undef;\n     *     return obj === undef;\n     * }\n     *\n     * function isUndefinedOrNull(obj) {\n     *\tvar undef;\n     *     return obj === undef || obj === null;\n     * }\n     *\n     * function isArray(obj) {\n     *     return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj) === \"[object Array]\";\n     * }\n     *\n     * function isBoolean(obj) {\n     *     var undef, type = typeof obj;\n     *     return !isUndefinedOrNull(obj) && type === \"boolean\" || type === \"Boolean\";\n     * }\n     *\n     * function isString(obj) {\n     *     return !isUndefinedOrNull(obj) && (typeof obj === \"string\" || obj instanceof String);\n     * }\n     *\n     * var myExtender = extender.define({\n     *\tisUndefined : isUndefined,\n     *\tisUndefinedOrNull : isUndefinedOrNull,\n     *\tisArray : isArray,\n     *\tisBoolean : isBoolean,\n     *\tisString : isString\n     * });\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * To use\n     *\n     * ```\n     * var undef;\n     * myExtender(\"hello\").isUndefined().value(); //false\n     * myExtender(undef).isUndefined().value(); //true\n     * ```\n     *\n     * You can also chain extenders so that they accept multiple types and decorates accordingly.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * myExtender\n     *     .define(isArray, {\n     *\t\tpluck: function (arr, m) {\n     *\t\t\tvar ret = [];\n     *\t\t\tfor (var i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; i++) {\n     *\t\t\t\tret.push(arr[i][m]);\n     *\t\t\t}\n     *\t\t\treturn ret;\n     *\t\t}\n     *\t})\n     *     .define(isBoolean, {\n     *\t\tinvert: function (val) {\n     *\t\t\treturn !val;\n     *\t\t}\n     *\t});\n     *\n     * myExtender([{a: \"a\"},{a: \"b\"},{a: \"c\"}]).pluck(\"a\").value(); //[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\n     * myExtender(\"I love javascript!\").toArray(/\\s+/).pluck(\"0\"); //[\"I\", \"l\", \"j\"]\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * Notice that we reuse the same extender as defined above.\n     *\n     * **Return Values**\n     *\n     * When creating an extender if you return a value from one of the decoration functions then that value will also be decorated. If you do not return any values then the extender will be returned.\n     *\n     * **Default decoration methods**\n     *\n     * By default every value passed into an extender is decorated with the following methods.\n     *\n     * * `value` : The value this extender represents.\n     * * `eq(otherValue)` : Tests strict equality of the currently represented value to the `otherValue`\n     * * `neq(oterValue)` : Tests strict inequality of the currently represented value.\n     * * `print` : logs the current value to the console.\n     *\n     * **Extender initialization**\n     *\n     * When creating an extender you can also specify a constructor which will be invoked with the current value.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * myExtender.define(isString, {\n     *\tconstructor : function(val){\n     *     //set our value to the string trimmed\n     *\t\tthis._value = val.trimRight().trimLeft();\n     *\t}\n     * });\n     * ```\n     *\n     * **`noWrap`**\n     *\n     * `extender` also allows you to specify methods that should not have the value wrapped providing a cleaner exit function other than `value()`.\n     *\n     * For example suppose you have an API that allows you to build a validator, rather than forcing the user to invoke the `value` method you could add a method called `validator` which makes more syntactic sense.\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * var myValidator = extender.define({\n     *     //chainable validation methods\n     *     //...\n     *     //end chainable validation methods\n     *\n     *     noWrap : {\n     *         validator : function(){\n     *             //return your validator\n     *         }\n     *     }\n     * });\n     *\n     * myValidator().isNotNull().isEmailAddress().validator(); //now you dont need to call .value()\n     *\n     *\n     * ```\n     * **`extender.extend(extendr)`**\n     *\n     * You may also compose extenders through the use of `extender.extend(extender)`, which will return an entirely new extender that is the composition of extenders.\n     *\n     * Suppose you have the following two extenders.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * var myExtender = extender\n     *        .define({\n     *            isFunction: is.function,\n     *            isNumber: is.number,\n     *            isString: is.string,\n     *            isDate: is.date,\n     *            isArray: is.array,\n     *            isBoolean: is.boolean,\n     *            isUndefined: is.undefined,\n     *            isDefined: is.defined,\n     *            isUndefinedOrNull: is.undefinedOrNull,\n     *            isNull: is.null,\n     *            isArguments: is.arguments,\n     *            isInstanceOf: is.instanceOf,\n     *            isRegExp: is.regExp\n     *        });\n     * var myExtender2 = extender.define(is.array, {\n     *     pluck: function (arr, m) {\n     *         var ret = [];\n     *         for (var i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; i++) {\n     *             ret.push(arr[i][m]);\n     *         }\n     *         return ret;\n     *     },\n     *\n     *     noWrap: {\n     *         pluckPlain: function (arr, m) {\n     *             var ret = [];\n     *             for (var i = 0, l = arr.length; i < l; i++) {\n     *                 ret.push(arr[i][m]);\n     *             }\n     *             return ret;\n     *         }\n     *     }\n     * });\n     *\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * And you do not want to alter either of them but instead what to create a third that is the union of the two.\n     *\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * var composed = extender.extend(myExtender).extend(myExtender2);\n     * ```\n     * So now you can use the new extender with the joined functionality if `myExtender` and `myExtender2`.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * var extended = composed([\n     *      {a: \"a\"},\n     *      {a: \"b\"},\n     *      {a: \"c\"}\n     * ]);\n     * extended.isArray().value(); //true\n     * extended.pluck(\"a\").value(); // [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]);\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     * **Note** `myExtender` and `myExtender2` will **NOT** be altered.\n     *\n     * **`extender.expose(methods)`**\n     *\n     * The `expose` method allows you to add methods to your extender that are not wrapped or automatically chained by exposing them on the extender directly.\n     *\n     * ```\n     * var isMethods = {\n     *      isFunction: is.function,\n     *      isNumber: is.number,\n     *      isString: is.string,\n     *      isDate: is.date,\n     *      isArray: is.array,\n     *      isBoolean: is.boolean,\n     *      isUndefined: is.undefined,\n     *      isDefined: is.defined,\n     *      isUndefinedOrNull: is.undefinedOrNull,\n     *      isNull: is.null,\n     *      isArguments: is.arguments,\n     *      isInstanceOf: is.instanceOf,\n     *      isRegExp: is.regExp\n     * };\n     *\n     * var myExtender = extender.define(isMethods).expose(isMethods);\n     *\n     * myExtender.isArray([]); //true\n     * myExtender([]).isArray([]).value(); //true\n     *\n     * ```\n     *\n     *\n     * **Using `instanceof`**\n     *\n     * When using extenders you can test if a value is an `instanceof` of an extender by using the instanceof operator.\n     *\n     * ```javascript\n     * var str = myExtender(\"hello\");\n     *\n     * str instanceof myExtender; //true\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ## Examples\n     *\n     * To see more examples click
